# OIT-Roman-Numerals
OIT Code Challenge: Decimal to Roman Numeral Converter

## Process
### Structure
* I want there to be an easy way to use the program, so it's been clear from the start that I want to have a `main.py` file to run and a seperate file that includes the funcitons
* After some deliberation, I've decided to use 3 different functions in my `r_numeral_functions.py` file
* `check_input` and `rn_to_decimal` could probably be combined into one function with slightly improved efficiency, but that would violate single-responsibility rule
